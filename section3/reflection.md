## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- I identify heavily with Carmen's reflection on her fixed mindset before she "hacked a growth mindset." When I was younger, I was quick to quit things that I didn't get right away. I knew that it took struggle and constant practice before anyone gets good at anything but I really hated the idea that other people could see that I was having a hard time learning something and judge me for it. Even coding was something younger me would never have imagined doing because I was convinced that I wasn't a logical person. Shifting into a growth mindset has helped me learn that I've been comparing my progress and process to other people instead of going at a pace that made most sense for me.

- "Can you imagine punishing yourself for every line of code that didn't run properly?" I really love this question from the article because it interrupts my stream of self criticism as I'm learning more about coding. By accepting that mistakes are important and inevitable when I'm learning, it takes the pressure off of getting right the first time and instead helps me slow down and invest time in fully understanding a new concept before moving on.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

My enrollment at Turing was a big life change. I'm taking up the challenge of learning a new industry and all the technical skills required for it. I know it's going to be difficult and confusing but I'm excited for everything I'll learn about coding and myself along the way.

One thing, I'm still working on improving is setting SMART goals. I still overestimate how much energy and focus I have to work. Sometimes, I won't split my work up in a manageable way and end up stressed and overwhelmed closer to the deadline of projects/work. The Marinara Pomodoro extension on Google Chrome has been helping me pace my scheduled study hours though!  

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```ruby
puts states["IA"]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```ruby
#all keys
puts states.keys

#all values
puts states.values
```

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Array is used for things that need to be in a certain order. They only need to be looked up by a numeric index.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
