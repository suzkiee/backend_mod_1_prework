## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  I love the advice from the SuperLearner article, especially the points around adopting growth mindset and taking short breaks, early and often. I had to unlearn and obsession with a perfect result in college and learn to love the process instead. I used to be afraid to take risks or try new things because I didn't want to fail more than anything else. I also didn't like when people saw me struggling to understand things which also meant that I learned in a really isolated way and rarely asked for help. This was a good reminder of the new habits I've made and am trying to continue to build. One piece of advice from the article that I'd love to make more effort in is reading more often. I do read a lot of things online but I tend to skim  information instead of reading the entire thing. I think I should put more practice in thoroughly understanding what I'm reading.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    print "Hello World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    #

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
    An integer is a whole number that is either positive or negative. A float is an number with a decimal value - or a value the "floats" between two whole numbers. It can also be negative and positive.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    animal = 'zebra'

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
    print animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    print "I saw a #{animal} at the zoo!"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
    gets and gets.chomp (for a cleaner result)

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
  String interpolation: used to combine strings together
   name = "Mel"
   puts "Hi, #{name}! How are you?"

   => Hi, Mel! How are you?

  String.length will return the number of characters in the given string, including the whitespaces.
  name = "Mel "
  puts name.length

  => 4
